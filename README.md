# Importing items from a MongoDB database into a merchant account on Arcadier

A simple NodeJS script to help me import a database of 10k+ items from a MongoDB database to a merchant account on my own Arcadier marketplace. `nodemon` was used to run this script (src/import.js) from the terminal using `npm start`. The script also uses MongoDB's npm package to facilitate connection between MongoDB and Arcadier's APIs.
